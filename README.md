## Abstract
The #MeToo movement has transformed social media platforms into spaces for activism and awareness around sexual harassment and gender equality. This research analyzes public discourse by applying topic modeling (LDA) and sentiment analysis to a dataset of over 390,000 tweets. The findings reveal five dominant themes:
- Sexual harassment and victimization
- Personal opinions about the #MeToo movement
- Empowerment and personal choice
- Controversial opinions and public figures
- Sexual stories and voices in the movement

Using visualizations like word clouds and topic distributions, the study emphasizes the role of topic modeling in understanding large-scale unstructured data from social media. Sentiment analysis further categorizes emotional responses, highlighting the positive, negative, and neutral tones of the movement.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Over 390,000 tweets containing the hashtag #MeToo were collected from publicly accessible repositories.
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming were applied to prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Topic Modeling**:
   - LDA was implemented using Python's `gensim` library to identify latent themes.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Tweets were classified into positive, negative, and neutral categories using TF-IDF vectorization and logistic regression.
5. **Visualizations**:
   - Interactive plots and word clouds were created using `matplotlib` and `pyLDAvis` to represent topics and sentiments.

## Results
- **Key Themes**: The primary topics include narratives of harassment, empowerment, and the public's perception of the movement.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Most tweets were positive, reflecting hope and solidarity. Negative sentiments pointed to anger or dissatisfaction with systemic issues.
- **Visualizations**: Word clouds and topic distributions provided clear insights into public discourse trends.
